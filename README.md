We introduce __MetaVision3D__, a novel pipeline driven by computer vision techniques for the transformation of serial 2D MALDI mass spectrometry imaging sections into a high-resolution 3D spatial metabolome. Our framework employs advanced algorithms for image registration, normalization, and interpolation to enable the integration of serial 2D tissue sections, thereby generating a comprehensive 3D model of unique diverse metabolites across host tissues at mesoscale.

## Installation

1. Download MetaVision3D:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XinBiostats/MetaVision3D
```
2. Requirements: MetaVision3D is implemented in Python. To install requirements
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
## Usage
1. Download data from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/tbsqj4d27zsqbkexxak8r/AI3TuR-k6zvliJTHWx8mF-c?rlkey=aznpybkek32cgg84mi9dvovtp&st=f6l50m6w&dl=0) and put downloaded data to "./MetaVision3D/data/"
2. We created a demo ([demo.ipynb](https://github.com/XinBiostats/MetaVision3D/blob/main/demo.ipynb)) to demonstrate how to use MetaVision3D. The results will be displayed inline or saved by users.
