<!--- We present a method for the simultaneous analysis of spatial metabolome, lipidome, and glycome from a single tissue section using mass spectrometry imaging. Our workflow includes a computational pipeline called __Spatial Augmented Multiomics Interface (SAMI)__ that offers multiomics integration, high dimensionality clustering, spatial anatomical mapping with matched multiomics features, and metabolic pathway enrichment to providing unprecedented insights into the spatial distribution and interaction of these biomolecules in mammalian tissue biology.

## Installation
1. Download MetaVision3D:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XinBiostats/MetaVision3D
```
2. Requirements: MetaVision3D is implemented in Python. To install requirements

```
## Usage
1. Download data from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/9ntjdocvj3rlopjrjnrxu/h?dl=0&rlkey=3ipjglxydmiioxika44bw2lzv) and put downloaded data into datasets folder.
2. We created a demo ([demo.ipynb](https://github.com/XinBiostats/SAMI/blob/main/demo/demo.ipynb)) to demonstrate how to use SAMI. The results will be displayed inline or saved by users.
